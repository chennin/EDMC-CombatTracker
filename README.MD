## Installation

Unzip the release zip into the EDMC plugins* directory. Restart EDMC to find the plugin.

\* You can find the plugins directory in EDMC Settings -> plugins tab. directory.  


## Usage

Massacre missions are grouped by faction, and their total required kill count is displayed alongside the faction name.

As missions are completed, the total kill count for that faction will be updated.

**NOTE:** The kill counts are **_not_** updated as you destroy enemy ships. They are only updated when you complete your objective.
